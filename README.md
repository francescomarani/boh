# Planning and Decision Making Project

## Overview
This project focuses on **planning and decision-making algorithms** for robotic systems. Specifically, we are using the **Albert mobile manipulator robot** in an **OpenAI Gym environment** to solve a **collaboration task**. The goal is to develop strategies that allow the robot to make decisions, plan actions, and coordinate effectively in collaborative scenarios.

## Collaboration Task
The Albert robot is tasked with working alongside a human or another robot to complete a set of objectives in a simulated environment. These tasks may include:
- Moving objects between locations
- Coordinating actions in shared spaces
- Planning sequences of actions to achieve common goals
- Making real-time decisions based on environmental changes

The project emphasizes **autonomous decision-making** and **efficient planning** to improve collaboration and task performance.

## Features
- Planning and decision-making algorithms for collaborative robotics
- Simulation of the Albert robot in OpenAI Gym
- Evaluation of collaboration strategies in static and dynaimc environments
- Visualization of robot actions and task progress

## Installation
